Overview: A dog-themed token with a playful “heist” narrative, Ski Mask Dog emphasizes privacy and freedom of expression. Its community-driven approach and cultural references (e.g., Donald Trump, Rick Ross) fuel its appeal, though it lacks significant utility.

Why It Ranks High: Its viral branding and community engagement make it a speculative favorite, with potential for short-term gains.
